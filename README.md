### RFIDSchoolAttendance

RFIDSchoolAttendance is a comprehensive attendance system designed for schools. It uses RFID technology combined with geofencing and location-based tracking to monitor student attendance. The system allows teachers to capture attendance records automatically based on students' proximity to designated geofence boundaries set by the school administrator. Students' locations are tracked with their consent, and attendance is logged in real-time using a semi-geofencing approach. This project aims to streamline the attendance process, improve accuracy, and enhance overall school management.
